Merlion  Car  Rental  (MCR) is a new car rental company with planned outlets strategically 
located  at  different  parts  of  Singapore.  The  company  will  commence  business  operation  in  
January 2023  and is currently preparing for its  launch. As part of the preparation, MCR has 
engaged  Kent  Ridge  Technology  (KRT),  a  global  technology  consulting  and  solution  
development  company  that  is  headquartered  in  Singapore,  to  develop  a  new  Car  Rental  
Management  System  (CaRMS)  to  support  its  core  business  processes.  More  specifically,  
the  new  CaRMS  will  be  used  by  MCR  to  manage  its  car  inventory,  price  packages,  rentals, 
employees and customers. The customers of MCR will also be using the system to rent cars. 
 
In addition to its own internal use, the CaRMS will also be exposed to external partners such 
as  price  comparison  websites,  online  travel  websites  and  travel  agencies.  This  will  allow  
MCR to sell its car inventory to a wider audience. At this juncture, MCR has already inked an 
agreement with Holiday.com. This would allow users of Holiday.comâ€™s Holiday 
Reservation System to search for and rent cars from MCR as part of their holiday packages. 
 
You  and  your  partner  have  recently  been  recruited  by  KRT  to  design  and  develop  this 
exciting enterprise-scale software system. You are all roaring to get started!
